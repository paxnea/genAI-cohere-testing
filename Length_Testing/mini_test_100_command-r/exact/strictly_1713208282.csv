0,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the weakest of them all. It is an attractive force that exists between all things with mass or energy. It pulls objects toward each other and is responsible for the movements of celestial bodies, keeping planets in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around Earth.

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. It increases with mass and decreases with the square of the distance between the centers of two objects. This means that larger objects or those closer together will have a stronger gravitational pull. Gravity is also a relatively slow force, acting at a rate of about 1 inch per second squared.

Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity explains gravity as the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Mass tells spacetime how to curve, and curvature of spacetime tells mass how to move. This phenomenon, which leads to the formation of black holes and the bending of light, is our current best explanation for gravity.",186
1,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force behind the attraction between objects with mass. It is a relatively weak force individually but becomes significant when dealing with larger masses. The force of gravity arises from the interplay of spacetime geometry and the presence of matter or energy. 

The most famous description of gravity is provided by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other. This attraction is determined by the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton's laws successfully predict the motion of most objects under the influence of gravity, from falling apples to the orbits of planets. However, it was later found that Newton's theory is a limiting case of the general theory of relativity proposed by Einstein.",150

The concept of gravity has been central to physics for centuries and is most famously described by Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation. According to this law, the force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the square of the distance between their centers. Gravity is what gives weight to objects and causes them to fall towards the Earth and other celestial bodies.

It is a force that causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. The force of gravity on objects depends on their mass and the distance between them. 

The gravity we experience is called Newtonian gravity, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, which describes gravity as a force causing two bodies to be drawn together. Newton's law of gravity states that the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This means that larger objects or those closer together will experience a stronger gravitational pull.",128

It is an attractive force that exists between all things with mass, pulling them together. Gravity is a relatively weak force, but it becomes significant when dealing with large objects or masses. The force of gravity between two objects depends on their mass—the larger the masses, the stronger the gravitational pull. This pull determines the motion of celestial bodies, keeping planets in orbit around the sun and affecting the flow of rivers here on Earth. Gravity's influence extends infinitely, although its effects weaken as objects become farther apart.
