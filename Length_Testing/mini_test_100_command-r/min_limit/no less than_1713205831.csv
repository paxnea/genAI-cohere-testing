98,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force of attraction between objects with mass. It is a relatively weak force, but it becomes significant when dealing with very large objects like planets, stars, and galaxies. Gravity is responsible for the movements of celestial bodies, holding planets in orbit around the sun and dictating the paths of moons and comets. 

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved; the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull. For example, Earth's gravity comes from its mass, which causes it to attract objects towards its center. This force keeps us grounded and gives weight to everything on the planet. Gravity also has an inverse-square relationship, meaning the distance between two objects matters; the farther apart they are, the weaker the force of gravity between them.

The laws of gravity are largely attributed to Sir Isaac Newton, who formulated the theories of classical mechanics. Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation are still used today as the foundation for understanding the behavior of objects in our solar system and beyond. Despite Newton's successful gravity model, scientists, including Albert Einstein, continued to build on and refine our understanding of gravity, leading to the theory of general relativity. This theory explains gravity as a result of the curvature of spacetime, an effect caused by mass and energy.",232
99,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern physical interactions, the others being electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. It is a force that exists between all objects, causing an attraction between them. The force of gravity is responsible for the motion of celestial bodies, the trajectory of objects when thrown, and the weight we feel here on Earth. 

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved; the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull. For example, the Earth's mass creates a gravitational field that gets weaker with distance from the planet's surface, which is why objects fall faster the closer they are to the ground. Gravity also has an impact on light, causing it to bend, an effect that can be observed in the movement of starlight passing near the Sun.

The laws governing gravity are largely defined by the work of Sir Isaac Newton, who described gravity as a force causing any two objects to be attracted toward each other. These laws have been refined over time, contributing to our modern understanding of this fundamental force. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity also provides an advanced framework for understanding gravity, describing it as a result of the curvature of spacetime.",210
