Do you have any other questions about gravity or physics in general?",112
99,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force that gives weight to physical objects. It is an attractive force that exists between all things with mass or energy. When an object is thrown into the air, gravity pulls it back down.

The force of gravity on Earth is what gives us the sensation of weight and affects the movements of the planets, stars, and galaxies. The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved; the more mass an object has, the stronger its gravitational pull. Gravity's influence is so pervasive that it shapes the very structure of the cosmos, governing the motion of celestial bodies and governing the formation of galaxies and stars.

Gravity is relatively weak compared to the other fundamental forces—the strong and weak nuclear forces and electromagnetism—but it has the longest range. This means it has a cumulative effect over large distances. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity explains gravity as the result of the curvature of spacetime, caused by mass and energy.",175
