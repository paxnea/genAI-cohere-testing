0,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force of attraction between objects with mass or energy. It is a relatively weak force, but it has a significant effect because it acts over vast distances. The force of gravity pulls objects towards each other, and its strength increases with the mass of the objects involved. 

The most well-known effect of gravity is its influence on motion, causing acceleration, which is described by Newton's laws of motion. Gravity is responsible for the moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the sun. It also determines the behaviour of objects on Earth, holding them on the ground and governing the trajectories of thrown or projected objects.

Beyond its influence on our immediate world, gravity's effects can be seen on celestial bodies, shaping the structure of the cosmos and governing the movements of galaxies and stars.",151
1,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force that gives mass and weight to physical objects. It is an attractive force that exists between all things with mass or energy. It is what makes things fall to the ground and what keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. 

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved: the larger the mass of the object, the stronger its gravitational pull. This is described by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",126
2,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern physical interactions, the others being electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. It is a force that exists between all objects, pulling them together. The force of gravity is directly related to the mass of the objects, with larger objects exerting a stronger gravitational pull. Gravity is responsible for objects' weight, as it pulls them towards the center of the Earth. 

The most famous theory explaining gravity is Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. According to this theory, gravity is not considered a force, but instead a warping of space-time caused by mass and energy. Despite this, the force of gravity is often simplified and treated as a force for everyday calculations.",122

The most common experience of gravity is as the force that pulls objects towards the center of the Earth. This holds true for all masses, giving weight to everything on the planet's surface. Gravity also keeps all the planets in orbit around the sun and influences the movements of celestial bodies. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity explains gravity as the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.",133

The strength of gravity is determined by the mass of the objects involved; the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull. This is described by the equation: F = mg, where F is the gravitational force, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Gravity is also what gives weight to objects, as it's the force that causes a mutual attraction between all things with mass, including physical bodies and even light. Without gravity, there would be no concept of weight, and objects would simply move in a straight line at a constant velocity, as described by Newton's first law of motion.",169

Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity explains gravity as the result of the curvature of spacetime, caused by mass and energy. This theory accounts for gravity's most notable effects, although a complete theory that merges gravity with the other fundamental forces is still beyond our current understanding.",165
99,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force of attraction between objects with mass. It is a relatively weak force, but it becomes significant when dealing with large objects or masses. This force causes a planet or a satellite to orbit the sun, makes objects fall to the ground when dropped, and determines the tides' daily rhythm. Gravity's strength increases with mass and decreases with the square of the distance between the objects. Hence, larger objects like planets and stars have a more significant gravitational pull than smaller ones. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity best describes gravity.",106
