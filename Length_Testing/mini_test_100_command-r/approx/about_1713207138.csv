0,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern physical interactions, the others being electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. It is a force that causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. The force of gravity on objects depends on their mass and the distance between them. 

The concept of gravity has been central to physics for centuries and is fundamental to our understanding of the universe. Gravity is what holds galaxies together, keeps planets in orbit around stars, and controls the tides of the oceans on Earth. The strength of gravity on Earth is quite week compared to other fundamental forces, but it is by far the most significant force in the cosmos because of its pervasive and irreplaceable nature.

Gravity is described by the general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein. According to this theory, gravity is not a force, but the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other.",191
1,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and can be defined as the attractive force by which a world or other body draws objects toward its center. The force of gravity is a result of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. It is an interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. 

The strength of gravity is determined by the mass of the objects involved; the larger the mass of an object, the stronger its gravitational force. Gravity is responsible for holding objects on the Earth's surface and governing the movements of celestial bodies. Although gravity is relatively weak compared to the other fundamental forces, it is the most significant force over large distances. This is because gravity never completely switches off; it always acts between pairs of objects.",144
2,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force behind the attraction between objects with mass or energy. It is a relatively weak force individually, but it becomes significant when dealing with larger objects and those closer together. The force of gravity keeps planets in orbit around stars, and it determines the structure of the universe on the largest scales by shaping galaxy clusters and the flow of time itself. 

The strength of gravity's pull is dependent on the mass of the objects involved; the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational force. This force acts as a function of the inverse square of the distance between the centers of two objects. As the distance between two objects increases, the gravitational attraction between them decreases. Gravity is also responsible for keeping us grounded and dictating the trajectory of thrown objects here on Earth.",150

It is a force that exists between all objects, causing an attraction between them. The force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them, with larger objects and closer distances experiencing a stronger force. 

On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes them to be pulled downward. It also governs the motions of celestial bodies, controlling the orbits of planets, moons, and stars. The force of gravity keeps the planets in orbit around the sun and determines the trajectory of orbiting satellites.

Its influence extends to the smallest particles, playing a crucial role in determining the behavior of matter at the quantum level. 

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. It increases with mass and decreases with the square of the distance, pulling objects toward each other. Gravity is a pervasive force that shapes the very fabric of the universe, governing the grandest cosmic phenomena and the most subtle interactions at the subatomic level.",143
86,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force of attraction between objects with mass. It is a relatively weak force, but it becomes significant when dealing with large objects or masses. This force causes planets to orbit around stars, moons to orbit around planets, and apples to fall from trees. 

The strength of gravity depends on the amount of mass involved, with more massive objects having stronger gravitational forces. Gravity is also a long-range force, acting between all objects, regardless of their physical contact or separation. This means that even tiny objects like marbles have gravitational forces, although they are extremely weak and hard to observe. Overall, gravity is an essential force that governs the structure and dynamics of the universe, controlling the movements of celestial bodies and shaping the very fabric of space.",142
87,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern physical interactions, the others being electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. It is a force that causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. The force of gravity on Earth gives weight to physical objects and causes them to fall if dropped. 

The gravitational force of the Earth determines the weight of an object, which varies depending on the object's mass and the distance from the center of the Earth. Gravity is also responsible for holding celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies together. The most famous law related to gravity is Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that the force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the square of the distance between their centers.",134

It pulls things together. Gravity is responsible for the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets. The force of gravity on Earth keeps us grounded and gives weight to everything around us.

The strength of gravity is determined by the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. The more mass an object has, the stronger its gravitational pull. Gravity also follows an inverse square law, meaning that as the distance between two objects increases, the gravitational force between them weakens. This is because gravity spreads out over a larger area.

94,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and can be defined as the attractive force by which a world or other body draws objects toward its center. The force of gravity is a result of the curvature that mass and energy induce in the fabric of space-time, which causes masses to move along geodesic lines toward each other. 

The strength of gravity is determined by the mass of the objects involved; the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull. Gravity is responsible for objects being weighed down and for the motion of celestial bodies, including the orbit of the planets around the sun. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and influences their fall toward the ground.

95,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force that gives mass and weight to physical objects. It is an attractive force that exists between all things with mass or energy. When an object with mass is near another object, gravity pulls the two together. The force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. 

The most common experience of gravity is as the force that pulls objects down when they are dropped. This is because gravity is strongest near the surface of the Earth. The Earth's gravity is also what gives weight to everything on the planet's surface. The weight experienced is the result of the gravitational force pulling on the mass of the object. Beyond Earth, gravity governs the motions of celestial bodies, keeping planets in orbit around the sun and moons in orbit around planets.",151

When we think of gravity, we mostly think of its influence on planet Earth, pulling us downwards and giving us our weight. However, gravity is a force that exists throughout the cosmos. 

The sun's gravity keeps the planets of our solar system in orbit, and the gravitational pull of the moon causes ocean tides on Earth. Gravity's strength depends on the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. It's a relatively weak force compared to the other fundamental forces, which is why we don't usually notice its effects on small scales.
