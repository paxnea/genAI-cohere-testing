0,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the weakest of them all. It is an attractive force that exists between all objects, pulling them together. This force causes the planets to orbit around the sun and affects everything we do. Gravity is relatively weak because it operates over very large distances.

The strength of gravity is determined by an object's mass, with larger objects having greater gravitational pull. Earth's gravity comes about due to its mass and is what gives weight to everything on the planet's surface. Gravity's effects are felt wherever matter is present and grow stronger with increased mass. Gravity also causes tides, keeps planets in orbit, and influences the growth of the universe by causing its expansion.

We measure gravity's strength on Earth as 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2) and call it standard gravity. This force keeps us grounded and is essential for life as we know it, but it remains one of the least understood fundamental forces. Einstein's theory of general relativity best describes gravity, explaining it as the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.",190
1,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force behind the attraction between objects with mass. It is a relatively weak force individually but becomes significant when dealing with larger masses. Gravity is responsible for the motion of celestial bodies, keeping planets in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around Earth. It keeps the latter in place, and without it, objects would move off in a straight line due to the inertia of motion. Gravity's influence extends infinitely, although its effects weaken with increasing distance, making it difficult to observe at long ranges. This is described by the inverse-square law, which states that the force of gravity decreases with the square of the distance between two objects.",127
2,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the force of attraction between objects with mass. It is a relatively weak force individually but becomes significant when dealing with larger objects and distances. The force of gravity arises from the interplay of spacetime and the energy-momentum of mass, warping spacetime in the process. 

The warping of spacetime leads to what we experience as gravity, which pulls objects toward each other. This phenomenon is also responsible for keeping planets in orbit around the sun and the moon in orbit around the earth. Gravity is also responsible for the shape, movement, and tides of celestial bodies such as planets and stars. Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity best describes gravity.

79,"Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces that govern the universe and is the weakest of all the forces. It is an attractive force that exists between all things, pulling them together. It is what makes objects fall to the ground when thrown in the air and what keeps the planets in orbit around the sun.

The force of gravity on Earth is what gives weight to everything on the planet's surface. It is also responsible for the shape of celestial bodies, like the round shape of the sun and the moon. Gravity's strength depends on an object's mass and distance—the more massive an object, the stronger its gravitational pull, and the closer two things are, the stronger the gravitational attraction between them.

Gravity is a relatively weak force, but it is very important in our everyday lives. It is also the hardest force to escape from, which is why it is so crucial in the universe.",156

The strength of gravity varies according to the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. It is an ever-present force, acting between all objects, although its effects are noticeable only when the masses of the objects are significant and the separation between them is not too great.
