It is a relatively weak force, but it becomes significant when dealing with very large objects like planets and stars. The force of gravity pulls objects toward each other, and its strength depends on the mass of the objects involved. 

The most famous effect of gravity on Earth is what keeps us grounded and gives weight to all the objects around us. It also governs the movements of celestial bodies, from the orbits of electrons around atoms to the trajectories of planets in our solar system.

Gravity is described by the general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein. According to this theory, gravity is not a force, but a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. However, for most applications, gravity is well-approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other.",171

It is a force that exists between all objects, pulling them together. The force of gravity on Earth gives weight to physical objects and is what gives the planet its spherical shape. 

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects: the larger the mass, the stronger the gravitational pull. Gravity also diminishes with distance, so the further apart two objects are, the weaker the gravitational force between them. This is described by the equation: F = mg, where F is the gravitational force, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

It is a force that causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. The force of gravity on Earth gives weight to tangible objects and keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. 

The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects involved and the distance between them. The larger an object's mass, the stronger its gravitational pull. Gravity is also a force that acts over a distance; the farther apart two objects are, the weaker the gravitational attraction between them.
